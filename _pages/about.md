I am a graduate student in Computer Science at  <a href='https://www.nycu.edu.tw/nycu/en/'>National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University</a>, specializing in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Image Compression. My recent research focuses on integrating Neural Image Compression with Multimodal Large Language Models. I am proficient in Python and C++, with extensive experience in building machine learning models using PyTorch. Additionally, I possess strong English communication skills and have presented my research at conferences such as APSIPA ASC.

I earned my M.S. in Computer Science from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University in 2024, under the guidance of <a href='https://sites.google.com/g2.nctu.edu.tw/wpeng/'>
Prof. Wen-Hsiao Peng</a>. Prior to this, I completed my B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering at  <a href='https://www.nsysu.edu.tw/?Lang=en'>National Sun Yat-sen University</a> in 2022.
