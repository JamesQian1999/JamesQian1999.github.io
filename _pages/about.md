    <strong>Top Skills:</strong>
    <br> 
    <strong><i>Machine Learning (ML), Computer Vision (CV), Image Compression, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM)</i></strong>
    <br><br>
    My name is Chien Cheng, and I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science from <a href='https://www.nycu.edu.tw/nycu/en/' target="_blank">National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University</a>. My master’s research focuses on machine learning, computer vision, image compression, and multimodal large language models (MLLM). My master’s thesis, titled “<a href='https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.14371/3093' target="_blank">ComNeck: Bridging Compressed Image Latents and Multimodal LLMs via Universal Transform-Neck</a>,” combines learning-base image compression with a multimodal language model. This work has been submitted to the international conference ICLR and is currently under review.

    <br><br>
    During my graduate studies, I participated in several National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) projects and collaborated with my lab members to publish research in top-tier international conferences such as ICCV, APSIPA ASC, and ISCAS. Through these experiences, I developed strong technical skills, cooperation, and communication abilities. I am proficient in Python and experienced in using PyTorch to build the machine learning model, with expertise in handling the entire workflow from data preprocessing to model training. Additionally, I studied in the Philippines for three months after graduation, where I demonstrated my adaptability to new environments and my capability to perform independently across different cultures and languages. This further strengthened my ability to communicate, coordinate, and resolve issues in English.

    <br><br>
    During my undergraduate studies, I maintained excellent academic performance, receiving multiple academic awards. At the same time, I served as the president of a student club, where I successfully organized large-scale events with over 100 participants. This role shows my strong ability on leadership, time management, and multitasking skills.

    <br><br>
    I earned my M.S. in Computer Science from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University in 2024, under the guidance of <a href='https://sites.google.com/g2.nctu.edu.tw/wpeng/' target="_blank">Prof. Wen-Hsiao Peng</a>. Prior to this, I completed my B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering at <a href='https://www.nsysu.edu.tw/?Lang=en' target="_blank">National Sun Yat-sen University</a> in 2022.
