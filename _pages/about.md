I am a graduate student in Computer Science at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, where I am deepening my knowledge in machine learning, software security, and network protocols. My current focus includes implementing advanced image compression systems and developing conditional VAE for video prediction.

Previously, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from National Sun Yat-sen University. My undergraduate studies included significant projects such as the implementation of the TCP protocol using UDP and studying Huffman compression algorithms. I also researched secure device pairing and access control for smart IoT devices.

I have contributed to the academic community through several publications:
1. **TransTIC**: Transferring Transformer-based Image Compression from Human Visualization to Machine Perception (ICCV 2023)
2. **Learned Hierarchical B-frame Coding** with Adaptive Feature Modulation for YUV 4:2:0 Content (ISCAS 2023)
3. **Transformer-based Image Compression** with Variable Image Quality Objectives (APSIPA 2023)

I have been honored with numerous scholarships and awards, including the Taiwan Imaging-Tek Corporation Scholarship, Excellent Student Awards, and the Cathay Financial Holdings Customer-Children Scholarship. 

My programming skills include Python, C, and C++, and I hold certifications such as the TOEIC Blue Certificate and Advanced Level in Collegiate Programming Examination. I also enjoy teaching programming and have experience training students in logical abilities through Coding4Fun.
